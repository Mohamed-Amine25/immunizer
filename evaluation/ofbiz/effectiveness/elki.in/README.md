This is a sample dataset generated by our framework, when applied to Apache OFBiz.
It represents contextualized method invocation feature records.
For each method, we may have different invocation contexts, each one identified by the call stack to which it belongs.
This sample dataset for example is generated by the method "public int org.apache.ofbiz.entity.datasource.GenericDAO.update(org.apache.ofbiz.entity.GenericEntity) within a specific call stack whose id is 1553442325.
The JMeter/ZAP label on each line of the dataset is used just for the automatic evaluation of ELKI results.
